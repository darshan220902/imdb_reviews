# IMDB Reviews Predictor

**Objective:** Developed a machine learning model to classify IMDB reviews as positive or negative.

**Data Preparation:**
- Loaded IMDB review dataset.
- Preprocessed text using spaCy (removed stop words, punctuation, and lemmatized).

**Feature Extraction:**
- Used `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text to numerical features.

**Model Training:**
- Trained multiple classifiers: Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Created a pipeline for TF-IDF vectorization with Naive Bayes.

**Evaluation:**
- Compared models using precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Skills:**
- NLP with spaCy.
- Feature extraction with Bag of Words and TF-IDF.
- Model development and evaluation with scikit-learn.

This project demonstrates text processing and classification skills.
